; when we want to compute small num , it makes error
; larger num is not act like that.
;we can take a new guess like

(define (sqrt-iter guess oldguess x) 
   (if (good-enough? guess oldguess) 
       guess 
       (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) guess 
                  x))) 
  
  
 (define (good-enough? guess oldguess) 
   (< (abs (- guess oldguess)) 
      (* guess 0.001))) 
  
 (define (sqrt x) 
   (sqrt-iter 1.0 2.0 x)) 

#|but when x = 0 , it will never stop computing. Figured out why the procedure hangs on 0. It hangs because when the guess reaches 0, the delta between guess and oldguess can never be less than (* guess 0.001) because that evaluates to 0. If you change the '<' operator to '<=', the procedure will properly evaluate 0.
